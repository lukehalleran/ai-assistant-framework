📚 Current Goals & Activities
1️⃣ AI Project — “Daemon”

    Fully local multimodal AI assistant on RTX 4090.

    Features built:

        Short/long-term memory (ChromaDB-based)

        Personality cards

        Wikipedia semantic search pipeline (custom-built end-to-end)

        Basic symbolic reasoning & dreams system (currently OFF for performance)

    Recent focus:

        Memory stability

        Wikipedia RAG performance

        Planning agent architecture and personality layering

        Exploring eventual embodiment via robotics (not yet built)

    Vision:

        Advanced human-like agent with symbolic + factual understanding.

        Open to monetization as a business research agent or a personal assistant.

        Full local (no cloud dependency).

        Currently building and testing core pipeline.

2️⃣ Actuarial Exam P

    Took multiple practice tests, targeted for passing.

    Recently postponed May sitting → will retake later.

    Approach:

        Structured warmups, error review, endurance focus.

        Strong grasp of theory, small remaining execution gaps.

3️⃣ Grad School Application (OMSA - Georgia Tech)

    OMSA Application submitted

    Waiting on:

        Financial aid confirmation

        Final decisions (Fall 2025 start).

    Wants to pair OMSA with AI project + job for career pivot.

        Part-time tutoring (Wyzant approved, interviewing at Club Z, etc.)

        Bar/brewery job (interview soon)

    Target: Part-time + OMSA + AI project.

    Long-term career goal: Data science, risk analysis, ML/AI engineer, potentially geopolitical risk & strategy.

    Deep interest in AI, philosophy of mind, complex systems, history.

    Sometimes overthinks / perfectionist under stress.

    Likes clear next steps and iterative improvement.

    Highly adaptive — learned Python/RAG/embedding pipelines from scratch in ~1 month.

Social / Psychological

    Feels somewhat isolated; rebuilding social connections.

    Balancing ambition (Daemon, OMSA) with realistic energy limits.

    Deep internal identity tied to learning, building, understanding systems.

    Pragmatic but retains elements of philosophical exploration ("DAEMON" as deeper project vision).

🔄 Current State (as of June 10, 2025)

    Daemon project: core pipeline works, dreams OFF for now, personality layering being designed.

    Fatigue risk: moderate — 9/10 days worked in a row.

    Next decisions: how to balance project + job + OMSA prep.

    Agent should help with:

        Project prioritization

        Detecting burnout

        Tracking health trends

        Providing pragmatic next steps

        Helping balance "creative" vs "productive" modes
